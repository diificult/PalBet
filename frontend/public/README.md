  <p align="center">
    Ever told your mate "I bet you I could do a kick flip". Probably not but you've probably said something similar. Perhaps its a prediction that takes years to know the outcome, so by the time it comes round to it, you've forgotten! I've created a website where you can do exactly that, and not forget. You don't even have to bet real money, using virtual currency, you don't have to risk anything.
